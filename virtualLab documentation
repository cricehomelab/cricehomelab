I have a Dell Opitplex 7010 with 16 GB RAM where most of my current lab work is occuring the goal of this lab is to get a better understanding of an enterprise system and how to administer it correctly. To do this I am working my way through Paul Hill's course on active directory and group policy (https://www.udemy.com/course/active-directory-group-policy-2012/). As well as some other tutorial courses I've used to make my lab feel proper. A lot of what I am doing is basing my learning off of his course, but if I have any "I wonder if I can...." I take time away from the course to investigate how and if I can do it. 
I am primarily interested in learning things in whatever direction my brain goes in, and while this might be a slower way to master any one thing, I'd rather learn basics while I'm curious, because foundational knowledge is always good to have. Its something I see lacking in my own knowledge and the knowledge of people around me in my job.
My biggest goal from this is to be able to walk away from this feeling like I am better equiped to perform my job, and to be able to have valuable skills for my current and future employers. 


Running Notes of the creation of my virtual lab. 

2021-09-13
1. I reimaged my Dell Optiplex 7010 with a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS with Desktop)
2. Once the imaging was completed I made sure that things were up to date.
  A. sudo apt update
  B. sudo apt upgrade
3. Installed virtual box
  A. sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack
4. Utilized some reference material to get a basic system set up complete with router, domain controller, and domain client built inside of virutal box.
  A. Reference Material: https://securitytutorials.co.uk/creating-an-active-directory-home-lab/
  B. Downloaded PFSense ISO from the offical PFSense download page 
      1. Source: https://www.pfsense.org/download/
  C. Created a VM for my PFSense router
      1. Used a Bridged adapter, 512 MB RAM 10 GB VDI HDD. 
  D. Created a VM with the Windows 2016 Data Center Edition for Evaluation.
      1. This is a free version for evalutation and learning from Microsoft. 
        a. Source: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016
      2. Named virtual machine domainctl-01 in Virtualbox. 
      3. Named the virtual computer the same thing. 
      4. I set my static IP up
        a. IP:      192.168.1.2
        b. Subnet:  255.255.255.0
        c. gateway: 192.168.1.1
        d. DNS1:    192.168.1.2
        e. DNS2:    192.168.1.1
      5. I created a snapshot in virtualbox of this so we can step back to this configuration if needed. 
        a. Name: FreshInstallConfig
      6. Installed Domain Controller, DNS Server, and DHCP Server this virtual machine. 
      7. Promoted this server to be the Domain Controller. 
        a. I added a new forest and named it domain.local. 
        b. I set the Directory Service Restore Mode password. 
        c. Set the NetBIOS name as "DOMAIN"
        d. I left the database, log files and SYSVOL at their defaults which are listed respectively below. 
          - c:\windows\NTDS
          - c:\windows\NTDS
          - c:\windows\SYSVOL
        e. I saved the powershell script generated to the desktop of the domain controller (ADDSDeployment.txt) for future 
           reference.
  E. Configured DHCP server on domainctl-01
      1. On the Dashboard home I opened DHCP options I created a new scope under ipv4. 
        a. I set the range 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254
        b. I set the subnet to 255.255.255.0
        c. I left the lease duration at 8 days, which is the default setting. 
        d. I left the Domain Name and DNS Servers with the default setting. 
        e. I left the WINS server as Default also.
      2. I activated the scope. 
  F. Creation of a client PC to join to the Domain. 
      1. I downloaded a virtual box image for Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation. 
        a. Source: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/
      2. I had to install Zip Unzip on my Dell 7010 to be able to extract the OVA from the zipped file that downloads from    
         Microsoft's page
        a. I extracted the OVA file in virtualbox, once extracted I named this machine "client001". 
        b. Once the OVA was loaded, and before I booted it I created a snapshot of the device for a backup.

  G. Joining my new client to the domain. 
      1. To join to the domain I went to Start > Settings > About > Advanced Settings > Computer Name and selected the "change".
      2. Named the computer "client001"
      3. Joined the domain "domain.local"
      4. Used my domain administrator credentials to join the domain, and restarted the machine. 
5. Creation of OU's to organize my domain better. 
    A. Created an OU named Domain OU and several OU's within that. 
      1. Domain Users - This will hold the user accounts within the domain. 
        a. Domain Admins - this will be for administrative accounts. 
        b. Domain Users - this will be for end user accounts. 
        c. Innactive Users - rather than deleteing users it seems most organizations I am aware disable user accounts who are no 
           longer in the organization so I created this to better simulate an enterprise environment. 
      2. Domain Computers - This will hold computers joined to the domain. 
        a. Servers - for Domain Servers. 
        b. Clients - for Domain Client PCs and workstations. 
    C. Created Domain users to test. 
      1. Created a user under the "Domain Admins" OU.
      2. Created a user under the "Domain Users" OU. 
      3. Currently these will function identically as there are no policies to diferentiate them. 
      4. Tested both of these logins on client001 to verify that they were able to login. 
        a. As a further test I verified I could disable the accounts and they would stop working. 
6. I checked for updates on sandbox-01 (see step 2 for the commands I ran).

As a note most of what happened here was a bust I was looking to see if I could virtualize rasbian on virtual box. I think I can but the file format was not working when I mounted the file to the disk in virtual box it was an unfamiliar format so I am thinking that I just need to research it more. After that did not pan out I was able to image an Ubuntu server 20.04 image, but I never got to a login screen (I later found out I probably just needed to hit Enter on my keyboard). For this day both of those ideas got scrapped.

7. I realized I had a growing number of username and passwords and I would need a more secure way of keeping track of them that was not rogue memorization. I installed BitWarden on my sandbox-01 computer to act as a password vault. I realize that this would likely not be an enterprise level solution. For the moment this seems to me to be a decent way to keep track of the different passwords I am using and I should look into seeing if there are evaluation versions of enterprise level software in the future to get used to them as well. 
8. Setting a group policy to demonstrate the difference between my Domain Admin accounts and my Domain User accounts. 
    1. Created 2 very basic desktop backgrounds that would allow me to distinguish between desktop users and desktop admins. 
      a. DomainAdminDesktopBackground.png
      b. DomainUserDesktopBackground.png
      c. Created a folder on my DC for deploying Domain Assets C:\DomainAssets
      d. Within this folder I created a DomainBackgrounds folder.
