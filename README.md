- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cricehomelab
- I am currently working on building a small virtual lab on a spare computer I have. I am currently working through various tutorials
and courses largely revolving around system administration, and getting a better understanding of the architectures that are used in 
businesses. 
- Current lines of study.
  - Active Directory and Group Policy
  - Linux
  - Virtualization
  - PFSense
  - hardening my home network and segmenting my connections out for a better network overall.
