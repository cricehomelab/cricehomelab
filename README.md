- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cricehomelab
- I am currently working on building a small virtual lab on a spare computer I have. I am currently working through various tutorials
and courses largely revolving around system administration, and getting a better understanding of the architectures that are used in 
businesses. 
- Current lines of study.
  - Active Directory and Group Policy  
  - Linux
  - Virtualization
  - PFSense
  - hardening my home network and segmenting my connections out for a better network overall.  
  - Organizing my homelab to improve my efficiency and so that my fiance doesn't mind my workspaces. 
  - Setting up a VPN for my home network in a secure fashion. 
- A lot of my goals center around building skills but doing it in a way that I don't get bored doing just one topic at a time. 
  I want to move at a pace where I can pursue my interests as they come up, and sometimes that may mean my "main" course of learing
  and discovery may take a back burner while I indulge my curiosity.
